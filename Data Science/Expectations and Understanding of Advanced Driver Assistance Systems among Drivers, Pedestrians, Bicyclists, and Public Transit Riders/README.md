The project aimed to investigate the perceptions, understanding, and expectations of different road users regarding advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The study collected survey responses from 1,531 participants categorized into drivers, bicyclists, pedestrians, and public transit riders. Through data analysis and statistical tests, the study compared the responses of different road-user groups to identify differences in their perceptions, trust, expectations, and risk perceptions related to ADAS technology.

The findings revealed significant variations between drivers and non-drivers in their understanding, expectations, behaviors, trust, and perceptions of risk associated with ADAS technology. Non-drivers often had false expectations or intended to interact with partially automated driving systems as they would with conventional vehicles, which could potentially increase their risk. The study emphasized the importance of understanding all road users' expectations and behaviors when interacting with advanced vehicle technologies.

The project highlighted the need for better communication and education regarding ADAS technology to ensure safer interactions between vehicles and other road users. The results provided valuable insights for policymakers and designers of ADAS systems to address the diverse expectations and behaviors of different road-user groups. The study emphasized the importance of individualized or targeted approaches to address the specific needs and perceptions of each road-user category.

Overall, the project contributes to the understanding of how different road users perceive and interact with ADAS technology, and it provides recommendations for improving safety and promoting the adoption of advanced vehicle technologies.
