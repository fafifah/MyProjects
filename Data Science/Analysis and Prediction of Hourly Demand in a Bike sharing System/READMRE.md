The project involved analyzing the bikesharing dataset, which records the number of bikes rented in the Capital bikeshare system in Washington D.C. The main objectives were:

(a) Plotting the hourly demand of bikes in 2012: The hourly demand of bikes was visualized to understand the overall pattern and fluctuations throughout the year. Additionally, kernel density estimation was applied to plot the density of hourly demand, providing insights into the distribution of bike rentals.

(b) Developing a K-nearest Neighbor Regression model to predict hourly demand: The task was to build a regression model using the dataset to predict the hourly demand for bikes. Two models were created and evaluated. Model 1 focused on predicting the hourly demand for the year 2012, while Model 2 used 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.
