Objective: To analyze the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in predicting bike-sharing demand, providing insights for optimizing bike-sharing systems.

Dataset Preparation: Aggregate the dataset to hourly data. Divide the parameters into mean and standard deviation. Select the relevant input variables and the target variable (hourly demand).
Data Preprocessing: Scale the data using StandardScaler. Split the dataset into training and test datasets.
ANN Model Configuration: Build an ANN model with multiple hidden layers and neurons. Experiment with different configurations, including the number of hidden layers and neurons, activation function, solver, and learning rate.
Model Evaluation: Train the ANN model on the training dataset and evaluate its performance on the test dataset. Measure accuracy and compare it with other ANN models.
Performance Comparison: Plot the accuracy levels of the ANN models developed. Analyze the differences in accuracy among the models and identify the best-performing model.
