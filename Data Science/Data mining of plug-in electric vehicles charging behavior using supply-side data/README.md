This project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the charging patterns of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and identify factors that significantly impact their charging behavior. We conducted an analysis using a comprehensive dataset of 189,864 supply-side charging session records collected over a span of 13 months from 821 charging stations in Illinois, obtained from ChargePoint. Through descriptive and regression analyses, we examined key charging behavior indicators such as charging location, dwell time, and battery start state of charge (SOC). Additionally, we quantified the influence of various factors on these charging behaviors. The findings of our study are as follows: (1) PEVs tend to charge more frequently in the morning at multifamily commercial locations, with a lower start SOC compared to single-family residential locations. (2) Weekday and morning charging sessions are more likely to utilize workplace charging facilities and have shorter dwell times compared to weekend and afternoon sessions. (3) Single-family residential areas and locations with Levels 1/2 chargers exhibit a higher start SOC and longer dwell time in comparison to other locations and DC fast chargers (DCFCs). These insights provide valuable policy implications, highlighting potential timeframes and locations for incentivizing PEVs for grid services. Moreover, the identified critical location categories can guide future investments in charging infrastructure to alleviate range anxiety and facilitate the adoption of PEVs.
