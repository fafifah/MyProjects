The bike sharing system has revolutionized the process of renting and returning bikes, as well as facilitating new member registrations. With its capability to generate vast amounts of data, the bike sharing system presents an excellent opportunity for researchers to investigate its impact on traffic patterns, environmental factors, and public health. The aim of this study was to develop a nearest neighbor classifier to predict the total number of bikes rented based on the bike sharing data. In this section, I will present an overview of the data attributes and highlight some key analyses conducted on this dataset.
