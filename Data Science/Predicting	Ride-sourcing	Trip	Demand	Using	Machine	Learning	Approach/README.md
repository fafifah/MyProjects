Objective: To predict ride-sourcing demand in Austin City and provide valuable insights for transportation planning using ensemble modeling techniques.

• Development of a direct-demand modeling approach for ride-sourcing demand prediction.

• Data Collection: Gathered trip-level information from the RideAustin dataset, including trip ori-
gins, destinations, trip length, and fare. Supplemented the data with TAZ-level demographic data,
transit system characteristics, weather data, land use data, and other relevant variables.

• Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by removing outliers and irrelevant variables. Trans-
formed and scaled the data to ensure compatibility with the modeling techniques.

• Model Selection: Compared different machine learning approaches, including ensemble meth-
ods like Random Forest, Decision-tree, Gradient Boost, XGBRegressor, MLPRegressor, and
Bagging of Decision-tree and Random Forest, to predict ride-sourcing demand. Evaluated the
performance of each model using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean
square error (RMSE).

• Feature Importance Analysis: Determined the importance of different input variables in predicting
ride-sourcing demand. Analyzed the significance of travel-impedance variables, weather vari-
ables, socio-demographic variables, built-environment variables, transit-supply variables, and
land-use variables.

• Model Refinement: Fine-tuned the selected model by adjusting hyperparameters and optimizing
the model’s performance. Considered cross-validation techniques and grid search to improve
the model’s accuracy.

• Demand Prediction: Used the trained model to predict the total daily count of ride-sourcing trips
between the selected zones in Austin City. Compared the predicted values with actual data to
evaluate the model’s effectiveness.

• Analysis of Model Performance: Assessed the performance of different machine learning mod-
els, including ensemble methods, and identified the most accurate and reliable approach for
predicting ride-sourcing demand
