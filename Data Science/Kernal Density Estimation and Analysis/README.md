The objective of this project is to apply kernel density estimation to analyze and estimate the density of given datasets. By using different kernels and bandwidths, the project aims to visualize the distribution patterns and understand the underlying data. Additionally, the project focuses on selecting appropriate model parameters and evaluating their impact on the resulting density plots. The objective is to gain insights into the data, identify patterns or clusters, and effectively represent the density of the dataset using kernel density estimation.
