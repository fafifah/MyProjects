**Abstract**

We study the interdependence between transportation and power systems considering decentralized renewable generators and electric vehicles (EVs). We formulate the problem in a stochastic multiagent optimization framework considering the complex interactions between EV/conventional vehicle drivers, renewable/conventional generators, and independent system operators, with locational electricity and charging prices endogenously determined by markets. We show that the multiagent optimization problems can be reformulated as a single convex optimization problem and prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium. To cope with the curse of dimensionality, we propose the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based decomposition algorithm to facilitate parallel computing. Numerical insights are generated using standard test systems in the transportation and power system literature. For details see: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9319750
